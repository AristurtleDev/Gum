# InstanceMember

### Introduction

The InstanceMember class is used in the DataUiGrid's Categories to control which properties are displayed and how the user can interact with those properties.

InstanceMembers can be created manually or automatically.  For more information on using InstanceMembers in a DataUiGrid, see the [DataUiGrid pages](datauigrid/) and its subpages.
