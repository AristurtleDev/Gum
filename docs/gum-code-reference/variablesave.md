# VariableSave

A VariableSave represents a single variable on an object, such as its X or Y value.

VariableSaves can be of any type, can contain any value, and can hold values either on the Component itself or on a contained instance.

### Variables, Instances, and Gum Elements

By default an instance does not own its variables. Rather, variables exist inside of states which can affect the instance. For example, consider the following image:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (75).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>TextInstance displaying the text "Hello from Gum"</p></figcaption></figure>

In this case, the GameScreenGum is the owner of the variable, not TextInstance. The GameScreenGum has the following:

* GameScreenGum (ScreenSave)
  * Default State (StateSave)
    * Variables (List\<VariableSave>)
      * TextInstance.Text = "Hello from Gum" (VariableSave)

This relationship may seem complicated, but it is requires because the Screen can create multiple StateSaves (including StateSaves inside of other StateCategorySaves). The actual value of the variable depends on which StateSave is being considered.

Furthermore, the effective value of a variable (such as "Hello from Gum") can be the result of variables being assgined at multiple levels.

For example, consider that the TextInstance in the example above is setting its text to "Hello from Gum" at the ScreenSave level. This value **overrides** the Text value which is assigned on the standard Text object.

The following lists the levels where variables can be assigned:

* Base standard (such as on the Text under the Standard folder)
* On an instance in a component (such as a Text instance in a Button component)
* On an instance of a component through an exposed variable (such as a Button instance setting its text to "Quit" in a GameScreen)
* In a derived class (such as a derived ExitButton which inherits from Button, but sets the TextInstance.Text to "Exit")
* In a categorized state (such as a DarkMode state changing the color of a Button's background)

The hierarchy of which variables take precedence over other variables can be complicated which is why Gum provides a way to get the effective value for a variable.

The GetValueRecursively method provides a way to get the effective value for an object given a state. For example:

```csharp
var state = GameScreenGum.DefaultState;
var text = (string)DefaultState.GetValueRecursively("TextInstance.Text");
```
