# GraphicalUiElement

## Introduction

The GraphicalUiElement class represents any visual element in the Gum runtime. An instance of a GraphicalUiElement exists for every instance of the base rendering types (such as [RenderingLibrary.Graphics.Sprite](https://github.com/vchelaru/Gum/tree/8c293a405185cca0e819b810220de684b436daf9/docs/Gum%20Code%20Reference/RenderingLibrary.Graphics.Sprite)) as well as instances of components. When loading a .gumx file in a project (such as a MonoGame or FlatRedBall project), each Screen is also a GraphicalUiElement.
