# Stack Spacing

### Introduction

The Stack Spacing variable controls the additional padding between children when a container uses a Children Layout of either Top to Bottom Stack or Left to Right Stack. Stack Spacing serves as an alternative to adjusting the position of each item in a stack.

### Setting Stack Spacing

A larger Stack Spacing value increases the spacing between each child. By default Stack Spacing is set to 0 which means that no spacing is added between items in a stack.

Changing the stack spacing adds gaps between each child as shown in the following animation.

Stack Spacing can also be a negative value resulting in overlapping children. The items in the following animation are partially transparent to show the overlap.
