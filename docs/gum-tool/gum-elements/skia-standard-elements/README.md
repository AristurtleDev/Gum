# Skia Standard Elements

### Introduction

Skia standard elements are a collection of elements which use SkiaSharp for rendering. Skia standard elements provide additional types of visuals supported by Gum, but not all runtimes support Skia standard elements.

Skia adds advanced vector graphics support for shapes such as Arc, ColoredCircle, and RoundedRectangle. Skia also adds support for vector file formats such as SVG and Lottie.

At the time of this writing, Skia standard elements are only supported in FlatRedBall projects. Future versions of MonoGame Gum will add support for Skia runtime objects. If your project needs Skia, please make a request in Discord or on GitHub.

### Enabling Skia Standard Elements

Skia standard elements must be explicitly added to gum projects. To add Skia standard elements Select **Plugins** -> **Add Skia Standard Elements.**

After clicking this option, Gum adds new standard elements.

Once these Skia standard elements are added, they can be added to Screens and Components just like any other standard element.
