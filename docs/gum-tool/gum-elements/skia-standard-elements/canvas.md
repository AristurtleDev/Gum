# Canvas

### Introduction

The Canvas element creates an instance of a SKCanvas which can be accessed in code to perform custom rendering. The contents of the Canvas cannot be modified in Gum. Since it is a Gum object, it does provide all of the variables for positioning, sizing but the rendering must be performed in custom code.

Since the Canvas cannot perform any rendering in Gum, it appears as an empty container.
