# Arc

### Introduction

Arcs are curved lines with variable thickness. Arcs can also be used to draw wedges if the line thickness is large enough.

### Arc dimensions

Arcs draw inside their bounds, with the edge of the arc touching the bounding rectangle. The thickness of the arc remains consisntent regardless of the bound width and height.

The following shows an arc with a Sweep Angle of 270 degrees, being resized in the Editor tab.
