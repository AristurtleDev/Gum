# Is Render Target

## Introduction

`Is Render Target` controls whether all instances contained in this container render directly to the screen (if false), or if they first render to their own dedicated target before rendering to the screen (if true).



`Is Render Target` defaults to false (unchecked).

`Is Render Target` enables a number of graphical effects including:

* Container [Alpha](../general-properties/alpha.md) (transparency)
* Container [Blend](../general-properties/blend.md)
* Alpha-only [Blend](../general-properties/blend.md#alpha-only-blends) modes on instances contained in the Container

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of February 2025 the `Is Render Target` variable is considered experimental. You may experience issues when using this as it is being developed. Please report any problems you find through GitHub or on Discord.
