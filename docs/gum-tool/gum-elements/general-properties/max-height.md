# Max Height

## Introduction

The `Max Height` variable sets the maximum height in pixels. This value is applied after all other layout so it can be used to overwrite automatically-assigned height.

By default this value is `<NULL>` which means there is no `Max Height`.

If `Max Height` is assigned (not `<NULL>`), then the effective height cannot be larger than the `Max Height` value. The following animation shows that height is limited to a `Max Height` of `100`.

Notice that the `Height` variable can still be set to a value larger than the `Max Height`, but it does not apply visually.&#x20;

`Max Height` can also be used if `Height Units` is set to values other than `Absolute`. For example, `Max Height` can be used to limit the height of a ColoredRectangle when `Height Units` is `Relative to Parent`.
