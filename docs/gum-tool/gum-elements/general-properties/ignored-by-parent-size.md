# Ignored By Parent Size

### Introduction

`Ignored By Parent Size` determines whether the parent of an instance considers the instance when performing its sizing. This value is only used if the parent has a [Height Units](height-units.md#relative-to-children) or [Width Units](width-units.md#relative-to-children) of `Relative To Children`. If a parent has a `Height Units` or `Width Units` of any other value, then this value has no impact on the parent's size.
