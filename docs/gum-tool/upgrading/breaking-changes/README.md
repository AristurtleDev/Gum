# Breaking Changes

## Introduction

Gum attempts to be fully backwards compatible - all old projects should continue to work in new versions of Gum. Unfortunately at times, some changes are made to the Gum tool which may break old project functionality, or which may require projects to be modified by Gum. Most of the time these changes happen automatically as a project is loaded by Gum, requiring no manual changes. However, if your project is loading Gum files and interacting with them in your code, these changes may require updates to your project.

This section outlines the breaking changes and provides instructions on how to adjust to these changes.
