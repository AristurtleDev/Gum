# Inheritance Location

### Introduction

The Inheritance Location options allow you to control where inheritance is specified in generated code (custom or generated code).

### Custom and Generated Code

When an element is selected, its generated code is displayed in the Gum tool. If automatic or manual saving of generated code is enabled, then this generated code is saved to disk at the desired location. When generated code is saved, it is saved with the `Runtime.Generated.cs` suffix. An accompanying _custom code_ file is also saved in the same folder. This custom code is generated initially, but after that it is not re-generated by Gum. This pair of files allows Gum to continue to update the .Generated.cs file without overwriting custom code.

The Inheritance Location option controls whether inheritance is added to custom or generated code. In most cases it's desirable to keep inheritance in generated code; however, some environments (such as .NET Maui) may benefit from writing inheritance in custom code.
