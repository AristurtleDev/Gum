# Y

## Introduction

The Y property controls the vertical position for an object. The Y value represents the position of an object's [Y Origin](y-origin.md), using its [Y Units](y-units.md).

## Example

By default, an object's top-left corner is positioned relative to its parent's top-left corner.
