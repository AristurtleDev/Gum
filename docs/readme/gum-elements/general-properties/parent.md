# Parent

## Introduction

Parenting allows UI elements to be positioned and sized according to other UI elements. Parenting hierarchies can go many levels deep and the parent/child relationship can be visualized by the white line connecting the parent to the child when the child is selected.

## Example - Drag+Drop in the Tree View

To change the parent/child relationship in the tree view:

1. Select a child
2. Drag+drop the child onto the desired parent

The child can be detached from its parent by drag+dropping it onto the Component.

Drag+dropping onto a parent may set the Parent property to an instance inside of the parent's Component type sets its Default Child Container value. For more information see the [Default Child Container](../component/default-child-container.md) page.
