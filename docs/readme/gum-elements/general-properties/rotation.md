# Rotation

## Introduction

`Rotation` can be used to rotate Gum components. Rotation is measured in degrees, where positive values rotate an object counterclockwise about its origin ([X Origin](x-origin.md) and [Y Origin](y-origin.md)).

## Example

An object is rotated about its origin, which by default is its top-left corner:

Objects can also be rotated visually by grabbing the rotation handle:

Holding the SHIFT key snaps angles to 15 degree increments.

## X Origin and Y Origin

The [X Origin](x-origin.md) and [Y Origin](y-origin.md) properties define the point of rotation for an object. The following animation shows how changing origin values can affect rotation.
