# Rotation

## Introduction

The Rotation property can be used to rotate Gum components. It is measured in degrees, where positive values rotate an object counterclockwise about its origin ([X Origin](https://github.com/vchelaru/Gum/tree/8c293a405185cca0e819b810220de684b436daf9/docs/Gum%20Elements/General%20Properties/X%20Origin/README.md) and [Y Origin](https://github.com/vchelaru/Gum/tree/8c293a405185cca0e819b810220de684b436daf9/docs/Gum%20Elements/General%20Properties/Y%20Origin/README.md)).

## Example

An object is rotated by its origin, which by default is its top-left corner:

Objects can also be rotated visually by grabbing the rotation handle:

## X Origin and Y Origin

The [X Origin](https://github.com/vchelaru/Gum/tree/8c293a405185cca0e819b810220de684b436daf9/docs/Gum%20Elements/General%20Properties/X%20Origin/README.md) and [Y Origin](https://github.com/vchelaru/Gum/tree/8c293a405185cca0e819b810220de684b436daf9/docs/Gum%20Elements/General%20Properties/Y%20Origin/README.md) properties define the point of rotation for an object. For example, the following shows a rectangle rotated about its center:
