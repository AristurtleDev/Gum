# ColoredCircle

### Introduction

ColoredCircle are round shapes which can be filled in or drawn as an outline. Unlike the non-Skia Circle element, ColoredCircles can be filled in and provide more options for customizing their appearance.

ColoredCircles support Skia properties such as Has Dropshadow, Is Filled, and Use Gradient. For more information and examples, see the Skia Standard Element [General Properties pages](general-properties/).
