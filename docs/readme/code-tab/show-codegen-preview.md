# Show CodeGen Preview

### Introduction

This option controls whether generated code is displayed in the Code tab. If checked, generated code is displayed and is updated whenever a change is made in Gum.&#x20;

Usually this option can remain checked even if you are not using generated code; however, very large components and screens may generate a large amount of code, which can slightly affect Gum's performance when selecting objects or making changes. If you are experiencing slowdowns and you do not need code to be generated, you can uncheck this option.
