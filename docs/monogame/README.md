# MonoGame

MonoGameGum is a library which enables using the Gum tool and Gum layout engine in your projects. It can be used to load Gum projects and display them in your MonoGame project, or it can be used to work with the Gum _runtimes_ (such as ContainerRuntime and TextRuntime) without loading a project.
