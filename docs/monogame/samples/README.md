# Samples

### Introduction

The Gum repository contains multiple samples on a variety of Gum topics. This page discusses these samples, covering how to get them running on your machine and how to modify them to see different features in action.

## Cloning Gum Repository

Gum samples are located in the Gum repository. The GitHub repository can be found here:

### Opening Samples

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the \<Gum Root>/Samples folder.

Notice that multiple samples exist, each in their own folder. Each folder has a .sln file (some contain multiple) which can be opened to view the sample. For example, the sample showing how to work with Gum Forms is located at `<Gum Root>/Samples/GumFormsSample/MonoGameGumFormsSample.sln` .

The Samples folder is continually changing, and new samples are being added over time. The remainder of this page covers some of the most common samples.
