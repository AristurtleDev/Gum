# Font Values

## Introduction

Font values in the GraphicalUiElement can be used to change the font displayed by the internal Text object. If the GraphicalUiElement does not contain an internal Text instance, then font values are ignored.

Font values are ultimately stored on a GraphicalUiElement to support objects which contain Text instances or which are on platforms which may not support TextRuntime.

For more information on font values, see the [TextRuntime page](../textruntime/).
