# TextureLeft

## Introduction

TextureLeft controls the left side of the source rectangle of a SpriteRuntime's Texture. This value is measured in pixels. This value is only applied if a SpriteRuntime's TextureAddress is set to `Custom`.

## Example - Assigning TextureLeft

The following code assigns a SpriteRuntime's TextureLeft:

```csharp
// Assuming a Sprite's TextureAddress is set to Custom
sprite.TextureLeft = 32;
```
