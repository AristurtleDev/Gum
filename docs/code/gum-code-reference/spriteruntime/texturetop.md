# TextureTop

## Introduction

TextureTop controls the top side of the source rectangle of a SpriteRuntime's Texture. This value is measured in pixels. This value is only applied if a SpriteRuntime's TextureAddress is set to `Custom`.

## Example - Assigning TextureTop

The following code assigns a SpriteRuntime's TextureTop:

```csharp
// Assuming a Sprite's TextureAddress is set to Custom
sprite.TextureTop = 32;
```
