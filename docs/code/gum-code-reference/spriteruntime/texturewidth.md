# TextureWidth

## Introduction

TextureWidth controls the width side of the source rectangle of a SpriteRuntime's Texture. This value is measured in pixels. This value is only applied if a SpriteRuntime's TextureAddress is set to `Custom` or `DimensionsBased`.

## Example - Assigning TextureWidth

The following code assigns a SpriteRuntime's TextureWidth:

```csharp
// Assuming a Sprite's TextureAddress is set to Custom
sprite.TextureWidth = 32;
```
