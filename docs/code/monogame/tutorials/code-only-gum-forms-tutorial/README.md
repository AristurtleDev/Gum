# Code-Only Gum Forms Tutorial

## Introduction

This series of tutorials covers how to work with Gum Forms in code. This tutorial does not use the Gum tool and it does not load any Gum files (such as .gumx).

Code-only projects can be useful if you are adding diagnostic tools to your game, if you are evaluating Gum Forms, or if you prefer to develop without the use of GUI-based tools such as the Gum tool.
