### Introduction



This series of tutorials covers how to load a Gum project using all of the functionality provided by Gum for creating and maintaining MonoGame projects. This tutorial is intended for brand new users of MonoGame Gum. It covers the following topics:

* Creating a new Gum project (.gumx)
* Loading the Gum project (.gumx) in MonoGame
* Displaying Screens
* Interacting with Gum Forms UI
* Accessing Gum instances in code

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the Gum tool. Specifically it assumes you know how to:
