## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
This tutorial series is under construction and relies on an unreleased version of Gum. Look for this to be completed, and for a new Gum tool to be released, in mid April 2025.
{% endhint %}

This series of tutorials covers how to use the Gum tool to create UI for your project. This tutorial shows how to create a _full featured_ Gum project including:

* Creating and loading a Gum project
* Using Gum's code generation for strongly-typed access to your Gum project
* Using Forms controls including Button, TextBox, and ListBox
* Navigating multiple Screens
* Styling Gum Components

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the Gum tool. Specifically it assumes you know how to:

* Move and resize instances
* Create Screens and Entities
* Work with the Variables tab

If you are brand new to Gum, we recommend learning about how to work with the Gum tool by reading the Gum tool [Intro Tutorials](../../../../gum-tool/tutorials-and-examples/intro-tutorials/).&#x20;
