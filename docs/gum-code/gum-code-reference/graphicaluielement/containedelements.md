# ContainedElements

### Introduction

This property returns the elements that this contains. This should be used if the GraphicalUiElement represents a Gum screen. Note that the ContainedElements does not respect hierarchy - all contained instances are contained here whether they have a parent or not. Therefore, to obtain only the top-level instances, the Parent property should be checked.
