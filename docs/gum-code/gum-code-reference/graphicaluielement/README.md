# GraphicalUiElement

## Introduction

The GraphicalUiElement class represents any visual element in the Gum runtime. An instance of a GraphicalUiElement exists for every standard instance as well as instances of components. When loading a .gumx file in a project (such as a MonoGame or FlatRedBall project), each Screen is also a GraphicalUiElement.
