# SkiaGum

SkiaGum allows you to render Gum in any SkiaSharp canvas. This extends the ability to use Gum on any Skia platform including WPF, XamarinForms, and server backend. Note that if you include Skia elements in your project you may break runtime compatibility.&#x20;

For example, as of April 2024, Skia objects cannot be used in MonoGame projects unless the project is a FlatRedBall project.
