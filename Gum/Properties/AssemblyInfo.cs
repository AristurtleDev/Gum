// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
// 0.8.2 adds improved stacking + relative to children behavior.
// 0.8.2.1 fixes outline thickness not creating custom fonts like it should

//  - Fixed Drag+drop standard element into component folder crash
//  - Added support for renaming component folders
// 0.8.3.1

// 0.8.4
//  - Rectangle color can now be set
//  - Circle color can now be set

// 0.8.6.0
//  - Reorganized code for property grid (not functional, just moved files to be under the plugin folder)
